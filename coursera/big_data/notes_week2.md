#Notes Week 2

##Demystifying the Data Scientist
**Data Scientist:**
Bring technologies together, to find meaning in large, fast-moving uncertain data.

**Then** -> relational data bases
structured, schemas
**Now** -> beyond relational data bases. Volume, variety, volume, voracity.
raw, compelx, unstructured

**Challenge:** Integration of Data from different sources

##Finding Meaning in the Chaos
beyond traditional BI, warehousnig and dashboards
into predictive dashboards in a scalabale distributed manner

**Then** -> Sample, machine learning, build rpedicitve model, then score larger data set.

**Now** Just analyze al data and run models
Exploding sample size

Keep in mind Correlation vs Causality.

- New methods from research community (deep learning)
- Move beyond flat files to more complex data

##Data Scientist: The hot new gig in tech!
Shortage of 140,000-190,000 shortage of data scientists

Big part of the Enterprise
Chief Data Officer, Chief Data Scientist

strategic, tactical, operational decisions (Data driven decisions)

##What Makes a Data Scientist?
The environment has gone from from white-coat expensive PHDs, to Data Scientist and open source tools.

DS is multidisciplinary
very important to understand the **domain**
Undertand and  buy into the business strategy. how the algorithms will impact the business.

-Intelectual curiosity, intuition
-Communication and egagement
-Presentation skills
-Creativity
-Business Savvy

Modern Data Scientist:
1. Math and Statistics
2. Programming and Databases
3. Domain knowledge and soft skills
4. Communication and Visualization


##Digging Deeper into what Makes a Data Scientist
Survey results based on how data scientists think about themselves and their work.

Developer,researcher,creative,businessperson

Define analyst by the breadth of skills.
Most successful data scientist have substantial, deep expertise in at least one aspect.
Inherently collaborative and creative.

-Data manipulations at scale
-Analytics, PRedictive Analytics, Graph analaytics, Text mining,
-Communicating Results
